# This performs benchmarks of V's printing in different ways of printing 'Hello, world!' 10,000 times (10 times each = 100,000 times per algorithm) with new lines included. 
## NOTE: This program has only been tested to run on Windows 10. It theoretically can support Windows 11, Linux, and macOS systems.
## How do I run the program?
### 1) Install V from [these instructions](https://github.com/vlang/v?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-v-from-source) if you do not have it already to use this.
### 2) Open the terminal
### 3) Run `git clone https://github.com/bluelightspirit/v-printing` (which requires installing Git) or download the raw files from [here](https://github.com/bluelightspirit/v-printing/blob/main/testing.v) and [here](https://github.com/bluelightspirit/v-printing/blob/main/hello.txt)
### 4) Navigate to the directory with testing.v and hello.txt in your terminal (they should be in the same directory). [Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/techtips/change-directories-in-command-prompt/) can assist on Windows. [Here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-unix/file-system-navigation-commands-in-linux/) can assist on Linux. [Here](https://www.macworld.com/article/221277/command-line-navigating-files-folders-mac-terminal.html) can assist on macOS.
### 5) Run with: `v run testing.v` in the terminal
